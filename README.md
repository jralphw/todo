# Hello there!

This is a small project where I'm building a mobile To Do app. This is meant to be a web-app runing within a capacitor container.
The purpose of this project is as practice/learning. I intend for this to be the first full project in my portfolio.(Everyone is building Netflix/Disney+ clones these days)
The progress of this project is expected to be very irregular. This is due to the fact that I am in the middle of university searching and applications for my first year in fall 2023, among many other things going on.

You can find a Firebase-hosted preview [here](https://jrw-todo.web.app). 

## Update
As of 21st February 2023, the project has been completely torn-down adn development has restarted. The firebase version of the site is currently the old ver. and will be updated soon. Thanks
#### Note; 
1. This is intended to be a mobile app and may not do well on large screens. A fix for this is planned among the things being reviewed.
2. The firebase-hosted version will not necessarily be up-to-date on current progress.
## Resources
### react framework
The frontend framework holding everything together. If for some reason you haven't heard of it, [check it out here](https://reactjs.org).
### joy ui
A React component library based off of material UI. Really clean and nice to use. [Website here](https://mui.com/joy-ui)
### capacitor(coming soon)
Used to turn this web app into a client-side mobile app. Great alternative to Apache cordova. [Here's the website](https://capacitorjs.com/)
### vs code
Literally the world's most popular text editor. I don't think you need this link but [here it is anyway](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### fontsource
Used to apply custom font and provide material-icons to the project. [Check it out here](https://fontsource.org/)
## Plans

1. Plan to switch over from regular JavaScript to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in project. Done on 18th Jan 2023
2. Deploying a preview ver. of the app on Firebase or Github pages.
3. Will add iOS and android platform in capacitor for mobile deployment.
4. Create a cloud-save backend powered by [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
