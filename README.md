# Hello there!

This is a small project where I'm building a mobile To Do app. This is meant to be a web-app runing within a capacitor container.
The purpose of this project is as practice/learning I guess. I intend for this to be the first full project in my portfolio.(Everyone is building Netflix/Disney+ clones these days)
The progress of this project is expected to be very irregular... but I'll finish it, sooner rather than later.
## Resources

### react framework
The frontend framework holding everything together. If for some reason you haven't heard of it, [check it out here](https://reactjs.org).

### joy ui
A React component library based off of material UI. Really clean and nice to use. [Website here](https://mui.com/joy-ui)

### capacitor
Used to turn this web app into a client-side mobile app. Great alternative to Apache cordova. [Here's the website](https://capacitorjs.com/)

### vs code
Literally the world's most popular text editor. I don't think you deed thi link but (just in case)[https://code.visualstudio.com/]

## Plans

1. Plan to switch over from regular JavaScript to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in project. Coming soon.
2. Will add iOS platform in capacitor for well... iOS version ofc.
